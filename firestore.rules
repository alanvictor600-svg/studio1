/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Bolão Potiguar app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has exclusive access to their profile data and associated tickets.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Each user's lottery tickets are stored in `/users/{userId}/tickets/{ticketId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data, enforced through path-based matching and the `isOwner()` function.
 * - Listing of tickets is restricted to the owner of the tickets.
 * - Users are identified using their Firebase Auth UID, which must match the `userId` in the Firestore paths.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` field in the Ticket entity is used to enforce ownership and avoid `get()` calls.
