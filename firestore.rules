/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Bolão Potiguar app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, with special privileges for administrators.
 * Each user has exclusive access to their profile data.
 * Admins can manage users, draws, and view system-wide data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Each user's lottery tickets are stored in `/users/{userId}/tickets/{ticketId}`.
 * - Draws are stored in `/draws/{drawId}`.
 * - Historical data for sellers and admin summaries are stored in their respective collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data, unless they are an admin.
 * - Admins can list and update any user profile.
 * - Ticket access is restricted to the buyer or seller, and admins.
 * - Draws can be read by any signed-in user, but only written/deleted by admins.
 * - History collections are protected, accessible only by the relevant user or an admin.
 * - The root `tickets` collection is queryable by buyer/seller ID or by an admin.
